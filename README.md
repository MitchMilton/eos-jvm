# eos-jvm
EOS client libraries developed for the JVM, you can see these libraries in action by viewing the source of [eosreach](https://github.com/memtrip/eosreach), an open source wallet for Android.

## eos-core
Create EOS key pairs and sign transactions, a local jvm replacement of wallet/sign_transaction.

## eos-http-rpc
HTTP client for interacting with the nodeos RPC API.

## eos-chain-actions
Higher level requests for common actions performed on EOS e.g; transfer funds, create account, delegate bandwidth.

## eos-abi-writer
Utility library for writing jvm data types to abi bytes, a local jvm replacement of chain/abi_json_to_bin.

## eos-abi-writer-preprocessor
Write the contents of jvm objects to abi bytes, annotation preprocessing is used to generate the boilerplate code for you.
